    "This lab covered a number of topics so let's recap:\n",
    "- First, we looked at a simple example of a graphical model and showed how to go about efficiently generating samples from a distribution that factorises over the graph using ancestral sampling.\n",
    "- We demonstrated the power of sampling by using samples to estimate quantities relating to the distribution.\n",
    "- We then looked at using the concepts of MCMC algorithms to generate samples from probability densities that are otherwise difficult to sample from and implemented the Metropolis algorithm.\n",
    "- Finally, we looked at the PyMC python library and how its efficient implementations of MCMC algorithms can be utilised within a Bayesian Linear Regression model.\n",
