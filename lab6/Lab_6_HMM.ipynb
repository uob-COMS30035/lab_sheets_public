    "# Lab 6: Hidden Markov Model\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lab we will look into Hidden Markov Models (HMM) to model sequential data. HMMs use Markov Chains to compute probabilities for a sequence of observed events. Moreover, HMMs are based on the Markov assumption, which states that the present state $z_n$ is sufficient to predict the future $z_{n+1}$, so the past $z_{0:n-1}$ can be discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"hmm.png\" width=\"400\">\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, we are in a situation where the states we are interested in are hidden, we cannot observe them directly. As we will see in Exercise 2, the part-of-speech (POS) tags in a text are hidden and we can only observe the words. From these words we have to infer the tags. Similarly in Exercises 3 where a robot needs to be localised, we cannot observe the robot's position but rather the measurements of its sensors. Both the tags and the robot position are called hidden variables because they are not observed.\n",
    "An HMM is specified by the following components:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A set of $N$ states.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A transition probability matrix $A$ where each element $a_{ij}$ represents the probability of moving from state $i$ to state $j$, s.t.  $ \\sum^{N}_{j=1} a_{ij} = 1$ $ \\forall i$\n",
    "\n",
    "* An emission probability distribution, the probabilities of observations $x_n$ being generated from a state $z_n$\n",
    "\n",
    "* An initial probability distribution over states. $\\pi_n$ is the probability that the Markov chain will start in state $n$. Also, $\\sum^{N}_{n=1} \\pi_n = 1 $\n",

    "## 2) HMM Part-of-Speech Tagging\n",
    "\n",
    "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging enables the extraction of meaningful information about words in a sentence and their relation to neighbouring words. Knowing whether a word is a noun or a verb provides us information about their most likely neighboring words (such as nouns are preceded by determiners and adjectives, verbs by nouns) and syntactic structure (nouns are generally part of noun phrases), making POS tagging a key aspect of parsing. Parts of speech are useful features for labeling named entities like people or organisations in information extraction, or for coreference resolution. A word’s part of speech can even play a role in speech recognition or synthesis, e.g., the word content is pronounced CONtent when it is a noun and conTENT when it is an adjective.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part-of-speech tagging is the process of assigning a POS tag to each word in a given text. The input to a tagging algorithm is a sequence of tokenised words and the output is a sequence of tags, one per token. Particularly, words are ambiguous as they have more than one possible POS and the goal is to find the correct tag for each situation.\n",
    "For example, \"book\" can be a verb (\"book that flight\") or a noun (\"hand me that book\"). The goal of POS-tagging is to resolve these ambiguities, choosing the proper tag for the context.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section we introduce the use of the Hidden Markov Model for part-of-speech tagging. The HMM can be used as a sequence tagger to assign a tag or class label to each unit in an observed sequence, thus mapping a sequence of observations to a sequence of labels. A HMM is a probabilistic sequence model: given a sequence of units (words, letters, morphemes, sentences), it computes a probability distribution over possible sequences of labels and chooses the best label sequence."
