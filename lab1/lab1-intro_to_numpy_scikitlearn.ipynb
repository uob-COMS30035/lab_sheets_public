Then, we used scikit-learn to fit the same function with only a couple lines of code and used the same methodology to fit a non-linear function after a polynomial transformation. \n", "\n", "### References\n", "- Bishop Pattern Recognition and Machine Learning: Chapter 3 for linear regression, \n", "\n", "#### Materials used to create the lab\n", "- University of Bristol's Symbols, Patterns and Signals course\n", "- Andrew Ng's Neural Networks and Deep Learning course on Coursera"]}], "metadata": {"kernelspec": {"display_name": "Python 3 (ipykernel)", "language": "python", "name": "python3"}, "language_info": {"codemirror_mode": {"name": "ipython", "version": 3}, "file_extension": ".py", "mimetype": "text/x-python", "name": "python", "nbconvert_exporter": "python", "pygments_lexer": "ipython3", "version": "3.11.5"}}, "nbformat": 4, "nbformat_minor": 4}
