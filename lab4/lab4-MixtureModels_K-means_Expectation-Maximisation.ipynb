    "## 1) Mixture Models\n",
    "In machine learning it is very common to construct a model of the observed data explicitly through the use of a distribution (e.g. Gaussian, Bernoulli, Categorical etc.). Provided the choice of the distribution type is reasonable, the observed data can often be used to estimate the parameters of the distribution (e.g. mean, variance etc.) that fit the data well. However, in many cases the data distribution is more complex and could potentially be *multimodal* which cannot be captured well with a unimodal distribution. Mixture models provide a conceptually simple solution to this problem by combining multiple distributions to form more complex ones.\n",

    "**What are mixture models?**\n",
    "A mixture model is a probabilistic model used to represent variables that have a distribution derived from the combination of a number of different distributions, each corresponding to some subpopulation of the overall population. It is worth noting that within a mixture model it is not required for any observed data point to identify which subpopulation it belongs to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formally, each data point $x_i$ can be assumed to come from $1$ of $K$ distributions (subpopulations). A latent (hidden) variable $z_i$ is used to determine which of the subpopulation distributions is used and this is modelled by a categorical distribution with $K$ categories, $z_i \\sim Categorical(\\phi)$, where $\\phi$ is a vector of $K$ elements containing the probabilities of each category. Note that $$\\sum_{j=1}^K{\\phi_j} = 1$$\n",

    "For simplicity, in this example we will assume that each subpopulation distribution is Gaussian which makes this an example of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM). The parameters of each distribution are their mean $\\mu_j$ and covariance matrix $\\Sigma_j$.\n"

    "- K-means assigns points to clusters based on the Euclidean distance to the means (centroids) of those clusters. In our case we know that our data is generated from a Gaussian Mixture Model so any given point must come from one of K Gaussian distributions. Using the Euclidean distance to the mean fails to completely capture the likelihood of a point being generated from a given Gaussian because it is possible for points further away to be more likely than points that are closer if there is a larger variance in that direction.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Using a Gaussian Mixture Model, we would like to be able to estimate the model parameters, $\\theta = \\{\\mu_{1..K}, \\Sigma_{1..K}, \\phi_{1..K}\\}$ that maximise the likelihood of seeing the data contained in the dataset, $P(X \\vert \\theta)$. These parameter estimates can be used to obtain a distribution over the latent cluster assignments, $P(z_i)$, for each data point $i$. This set of probabilities (distribution) over the clusters for a given data point is typically referred to as its *responsibilities* (i.e. how responsible is each cluster for generating this data point). The key problem that EM addresses is that estimating the model parameters directly from the data without knowledge of the cluster assignments is computationally intractable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively, the problem of finding both the model parameters and cluster responsibilities can be viewed as a chicken and egg problem. If the parameters for each Gaussian and the mixing probabilities ($\\phi$) are known then it is easy to compute the likelihood for each data point and build a belief about which cluster it belongs to. Similarly, if the cluster responsibilities are known then it is easy to fit the parameters of each Gaussian. This can be achieved for each cluster by fitting a Gaussian to the entire data set where each point has been weighted by the cluster's responsibility for that point.\n",

    "1. Initialise all model parameters, $\\theta$. This can initialised completely randomly or by running k-means first to get a starting point.\n",
    "2. **Expectation Step:** Using the current $\\theta$, compute the responsibilities, $P(z_i)$, for each data point, $i$.\n",

    "This lab covered a number of topics so let's recap:\n",
    "- We first looked at mixture models and showed how they can be used to combine simple distributions into more complex ones. For the case of a Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), we saw how to generate samples from the distribution using the idea of ancestral sampling (from week 3). \n",
    "- Next, we implemented the key steps of K-means algorithm and saw how this technique can be used to find clusters of data points within a dataset that are separated with hard boundaries. \n",
    "- We then looked at a different approach to clustering through the use of the Expectation Maximisation (EM) algorithm. We saw how this approach differs from K-means by modelling the individual cluster distributions to perform soft clustering.\n",
    "- Finally, we worked through an example use case of these methods by applying them to an image's pixel data to perform Colour Quantisation.\n",
